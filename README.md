# bbst
This is a proof of concept tool to perform black box system acceptance testing. It's written in PHP and leverages a few modules and other components.

bbst attempts to solve an issue where there aren't that many tools for performing black box acceptance tests of built servers. Many testing tools inspect inside (white box) but not from the end user's point of view. The tool contains several sample features for testing TLS and HTTP. Features are written in a BDD manner.

I wrote this for a class, Programming Environments and Software Tools, and it's a little rough around the edges.

In the future, this program should be ported to Python or Ruby. PHP isn't the greatest choice for system tools.
